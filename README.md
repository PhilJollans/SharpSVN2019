# SharpSVN2019

SharpSVN2019 is fork of the original [CollabNet project](https://sharpsvn.open.collab.net/)

The SVN repository of the CollabNet project is at  
https://ctf.open.collab.net/svn/repos/sharpsvn/trunk/

It is my intention to create a version which compiles using Visual Studio 2019, without consideration of older versions of Visual Studio.

Version 1.12.0.1 is now available as a nuget package at  
https://www.nuget.org/packages/SharpSvn2019.SharpSvn/
